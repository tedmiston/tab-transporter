tab-transporter
===============

Take all tabs in the frontmost Safari window and move them into Chrome.

I developed Tab Transporter out of personal utility because I couldn't find anything else that did exactly what I wanted.

## Use Case
- I've opened a bunch of tabs in Safari (such as new apps to check out), but I need to get them out of the way for now to focus on work
- The [OneTab](https://www.one-tab.com) extension handle this in Chrome, but it doesn't exist for Safari
- I desire to stash all of these tabs in one centralized location


## Usage

TODO

I launch it via Alfred, with `tt`.


## Alternatives

This section covers possible solutions that didn't work for me, which led me to create Tab Transporter.

- `Add Bookmarks for These n Tabs` *(doesn't integrate with Chrome tabs)*
- `Add These n Tabs to Reading List` *(doesn't sync with OneTab in Chrome, Pocket, etc.)*
- `Develop > Open Page With > Google Chrome` *(moves only one tab at a time)*
*(If you don't see this menu item, enable Safari's Develop menu in Preferences > Advanced.)*
- **[Switch](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/42431/switch)** supports going bidirectionally between any browsers, but handles only one page at a time, and consumes precious menu bar real estate. *Last updated: April 2012.*
